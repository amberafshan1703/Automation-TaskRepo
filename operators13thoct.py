Operators - it is used to perform operations in the operands
there are three types of operators depending upon the number of operands required

1) unary operator - only one operand is required
2) binary operator - two operands are required

Arithmetic operators - +,-, *,/,%,**- exponential operator,
//(it will return quotient) // is floor division
Comparison--- ==, <=, >=, !=, <,>
Logical --- and, or, not
assignment =,+=,-=, /=,%=,**=,//=

not in any other language
membership in, not in
identity is, isnot

++, -- not present in python

'''

a = int(input("enter the value of a\n"))
b = int(input("enter the value of b\n"))

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a%b)
print(a**b) # 10 ^3
print(a//b) # 10// 3 (10 divided by 3 and gives quotient
